# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The goal is to create a complete CI/CD pipeline for the Homebrew Bottles Sync System project that enables automatic deployment of the entire infrastructure from GitHub, including tests, and creation of a quick configuration that allows project setup with a single configuration file.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps developer, I want an automated CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions, so that every code change goes through tests and deploys automatically to different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN the system SHALL run automated tests including unit tests, integration tests, and Terraform validation
2. WHEN tests pass successfully THEN the system SHALL automatically deploy to staging environment
3. WHEN there is a new tag in format v*.*.* THEN the system SHALL deploy to production environment after manual approval
4. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL send alerts and stop the process
5. WHEN there is a pull request THEN the system SHALL run tests and display results in GitHub interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want quick and simple configuration, so that I can set up the entire project with just one file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I copy the project THEN the system SHALL require only editing a single config.yaml file
2. WHEN I configure the settings THEN the system SHALL automatically create all required terraform.tfvars files
3. WHEN I run the setup script THEN the system SHALL automatically configure all environments (dev, staging, prod)
4. WHEN the configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with fix instructions
5. WHEN I want to update settings THEN the system SHALL allow configuration updates without affecting existing resources

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive automated testing, so that I can ensure the code works properly before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL run Python unit tests for all components
2. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL run Terraform validation and security scanning
3. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL run integration tests with mocked AWS services
4. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL check code quality with linting and formatting
5. WHEN a test fails THEN the system SHALL display detailed information about the failure and how to fix it

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want automated environment management, so that I can easily manage dev, staging and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I activate the pipeline THEN the system SHALL support deployment to three separate environments
2. WHEN I push to develop branch THEN the system SHALL automatically deploy to dev environment
3. WHEN I push to main branch THEN the system SHALL automatically deploy to staging environment
4. WHEN I create a release tag THEN the system SHALL require manual approval for production environment deployment
5. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL send Slack notifications with deployment details

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security manager, I want secure secrets management, so that all sensitive information is protected and properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL use GitHub Secrets for all sensitive information
2. WHEN AWS credentials are needed THEN the system SHALL use OIDC federation without storing keys
3. WHEN there are new secrets THEN the system SHALL allow addition only through GitHub UI
4. WHEN secrets change THEN the system SHALL automatically update all relevant environments
5. WHEN there is unauthorized access THEN the system SHALL log and alert about suspicious access attempts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want built-in monitoring and alerting, so that I know immediately if something is not working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL check that all services are working properly
2. WHEN there is a deployment error THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts to Slack and email
3. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL create detailed reports on performance and costs
4. WHEN there is an infrastructure problem THEN the system SHALL suggest automatic solutions or fix instructions
5. WHEN the system is working properly THEN the system SHALL send weekly status reports

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a new team developer, I want clear and simple documentation, so that I can start working with the project quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read the documentation THEN the system SHALL include step-by-step installation instructions
2. WHEN I want to understand the architecture THEN the system SHALL include clear pipeline diagrams
3. WHEN I want to develop THEN the system SHALL include guidelines for local development and testing
4. WHEN there is a problem THEN the system SHALL include a detailed troubleshooting guide
5. WHEN I want to contribute THEN the system SHALL include contribution and code review guidelines

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a cost manager, I want automatic cost optimization, so that I don't waste money on unnecessary resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL automatically choose appropriate resource sizes for each environment
2. WHEN dev environment is not in use THEN the system SHALL automatically shut down expensive resources
3. WHEN there are high costs THEN the system SHALL alert and suggest optimizations
4. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL display monthly cost estimates
5. WHEN there is a cost change THEN the system SHALL alert if costs exceed a defined threshold
